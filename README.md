# Virtual Buchla 259 Wavefolder - Digital Modeling and DSP Implementation  

This project digitally models the **Buchla 259 Wavefolder**, a nonlinear waveshaping circuit used in **West Coast synthesis**. The implementation focuses on **real-time DSP processing** while mitigating aliasing artifacts using the **polyBLAMP (band-limited ramp) technique**.  

This work is based on **virtual analog modeling** principles and was developed in **MATLAB**.

## Project Overview  

The **Buchla 259 Wavefolder** is an essential component of West Coast synthesis, known for its **nonlinear wavefolding** that introduces rich harmonic content. This project aims to:  

- **Digitally model** the Buchla 259 circuit while preserving its timbral characteristics  
- **Analyze the spectral response** and minimize aliasing artifacts  
- **Implement polyBLAMP** as an efficient anti-aliasing technique  
- **Evaluate the digital model** against theoretical benchmarks and analog simulations

## ðŸ“Š Spectral Analysis

The model was tested with both sinusoidal and complex inputs. Results showed significantly reduced aliasing and preserved harmonic structures when compared to uncorrected models. Oversampling (8Ã—) and BLAMP correction provided smooth spectral transitions.
